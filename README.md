## Aim
The aim of this project is to create a map of Nigeria visualizing the number of votes scored by the APC party during the 2019 and 2023 presidential elections.

## Objectives
1. Identify the type of data needed for the project.
2. Scrape the election result data from the internet:
   - Download shapefiles for NIGERIA ADM_1 containing state boundaries and attributes.
   - Download attributes required to effectively visualize the election result for both years.
3. Clean the data appropriately (Data Scrambling).
4. Join the external dataset with the pre-recorded attributes in the shapefile using a common key.
